Basic Grids - 
To create a grid, set the columns, rows, column gap, and row gap. These options determine how the grid will look, and can be previewed before adding to project in the preview area at the top of the screen. 

Values - 
Column / row values are written as their cell sizes in whole numbers (with a pt suffix), or out of a total fraction, with the denominator of that fraction being all the numerators written added up. All cell values must be separated by a space. The value entered can also be a single number to create x amount of equally sized cells.

Column / row gaps are written as a whole number

Examples -
Try the following in the column/row inputs to see how they change the grid:
1 2 3 4 5
40pt 1
20pt 1 20pt
30pt*3 2*2 1


Adding Grid To Project -
Once you are happy with your grid layout, you can add it into your Figma document. To do so, select the layer you want to apply the grid to, if not already selected, and click the ‚ÄúApply Grid To Selected‚Äù button, you should see the grid over the selected layer, filled with the colour chosen in the ‚ÄúCell Fill Colour‚Äù


Merging Cells -
To create more complicated grids, you can build a custom layout by clicking on the cells (in the preview) that you want. Clicking on ‚ÄúApply Grid To Selected‚Äù now would only import the cells that have been selected. You can deselect a cell by right clicking on it, and you can merge multiple cells together to create a larger tile by holding on a cell and dragging it the appropriate size.


Saving Layouts - 
Saving layouts is very simple, when selecting a layer in Figma, click on the "Saved..." dropdown next to the "Apply To Selected" button. From the dropodown select "Save Current Grid" and enter the name you would like to save it under.
To edit your existing saved layouts, open the same dropdown, and select "Edit saved". You can now see all saved layouts, to delete one, simply click on the trash icon next to the appropiate row.

Auto populating created cells -
Instead of letting (easy)grid create empty shaded rectangles as cells, you may select more then one layer within Figma, which when clicking "Apply To Selected", would be used instead of the shaded rectangles.

---- DELETED THINGS ----

(Easy)grid lets you create a grid or layout in seconds with the ability to insert it onto any layer without the need to waste time doing math, allowing you to rapidly modify your layout until perfect. By using the four flexible options (columns, rows, column gap, and row gap) you can write out a layout that is the exact fit. 

you can create a grid and by also selecting a review card component, to create the grid with the review cards as cells.

 Autopopulate your layout by selecting more than one layer, allowing you to insert already created elements as the created layout cells. Letting you do things like fill up a grid with product images in a creative way in seconds by selecting the product preview layer alongside the bounding layer when clicking "Apply To Selected"

    NEWLY ADDED FEATURES

    - Save your layout and reuse them in other Figma projects to quickly insert your most common layouts

    - Quickly insert other layers as cells, by selecting more then one layer you can apply your created grid onto the first layer, with the remaining layers being used as content


grids that can be made without having to manually work out the sizing or positioning
well now that's going to be quicker then ever.


---- VERSION NOTES ----

- Added ability to populate layout cells with existing elements or components by selecting more than one layer before pressing "Apply"
- You can now save your created layouts and reuse them across Figma projects
- Some minor bug fixes

---- DESCRIPTION ON FIGMA PLUGIN PAGE ----


(Easy)grid lets you create a grid layout in seconds and place it into Figma without the math. It can also let you quickly align and scale pre-existing elements as layout-items/cells for a quicker design flow. By using the four flexible options (columns, rows, column gap, and row gap) you can write out a layout that is the exact fit and rapidly modify until perfect.

How many times have you had to create a grid or layout, and found yourself spending too much time finding the correct sizes for each element, messing around with spacing to ensure it looks perfect, or having to perfectly align it? This is where the (Easy)grid plugin comes into play.
